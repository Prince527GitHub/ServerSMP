### Setup
Look at the file `.env.exsemple` then copy the main stuff of that so like `TOKEN`, then follow [this video](https://youtu.be/BKlv__1OoGc) by Imagine Gaming Play.

### Uptime

All you have to do to keep your bot up is setup something to ping the site your bot made every 5 minutes or so. But because you paid you can just change a setting to allways run the replit.

Go to [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com/) and create an accout if you dont have one.  After verifying your account, click "Add New Monitor".

+ For Monitor Type select "HTTP(s)"
+ In Friendly Name put the name of your bot
+ For your url, put the url of the website made for your repl.
+ Select any alert contacts you want, then click "Create Monitor"
